Title: *Physics-Driven Synthetic Data Artificial Intelligence for Biomedical Magnetic Resonance*<br><br>Deep learning has driven innovation in the field of biomedical magnetic resonance, but encounters the bottleneck of insufficient or even unavailable training data. In this talk, we will discuss an emerging paradigm, imaging physics-based data synthesis for network training. Signal generation models, enhanced data generation and advanced neural network structures with representative applications, particularly on fast, parametric and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, are discussed.<br><br>Short bio:<br>![image]({{ "/images/xiaoboqu.jpg" | relative_url }}){: style="float:left; width:100px; margin-right:10px; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; border-radius: 50%;"} Xiaobo Qu received his Ph.D. degree in communication engineering from Xiamen University, Xiamen, China, where he is a professor and the vice director of the Department of Electronic Science, the director of the Biomedical Intelligent Cloud Research and Development Center, and the vice director of the Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Plasma and Magnetic Resonance.
