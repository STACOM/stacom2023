Title: *Artificial Intelligence for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Imaging*<br><br>Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) is the current gold standard imaging modality for heart, providing in-depth information on cardiac structure, motion, tissue properties etc. However, CMR is traditionally an expensive examination due to its slow imaging and complicated analysis. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has made significant advancements to improve the accessibility of CMR through accelerated acquisition and automated reporting. We will discuss the advancements of AI in the field of CMR, current challenges, and opportunities for future.<br><br>Short bio:<br>![image]({{ "/images/qiantao.png" | relative_url }}){: style="float:left; width:100px; margin-right:10px; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; border-radius: 50%;"} Qian Tao is an Assistant Professor at the Department of Imaging Physics, Delft University of Technology. Her research interest includes cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR), medical image analysis, and artificial intelligence (AI) for radiological applications. Dr. Tao has extensive experience collaborating with radiologists and cardiologists on clinical applications of CMR for diagnosis and intervention of cardiovascular disease patients. She serves on the Editorial Board of Radiology: Artificial Intelligence, and is a committee member of the Society of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Registry.
