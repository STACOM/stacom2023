The **Statistical Atlases and Computational Modeling of the Heart (STACOM)** workshop has been running annually at MICCAI since 2010. The 14th edition of STACOM workshop is going to be held in conjunction with the [MICCAI 2023](https://conferences.miccai.org/2023/en/) in Vancouver, Canada. The STACOM workshop is aiming to create a collaborative forum for young/senior researchers (engineers, biophysicists, mathematicians) and clinicians, working on: statistical analysis of cardiac morphology and dynamics, computational modelling of the heart and fluid dynamics, data/models sharing, personalisation of cardiac electro-mechanical models, quantitative image analysis and translational methods into clinical practice.

### Cardiac MRI Reconstruction Challenge

STACOM 2023 hosts a challenge on reconstruction of cardiac MRI (CMRxRecon). 

Please note different timeline for this challenge:

* 14 July :  abstract / placeholder submission on the [EquinOCS portal](submission)
* 14 August : paper submission by email to the organisers

Dataset: A multi-channel k-space dataset of 300 cases, including short-axis, 2/3/4-chamber long-axis cine and T1/T2 mapping, with approximately 500,000 images.
